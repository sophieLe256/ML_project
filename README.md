# Classification Using KNN and Random Forest
## Description
This project implements classification for five datasets using two algorithms:

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
### Random Forest (RF)
The objective is to compare the performance of both algorithms and select the best model for each dataset. The target accuracy thresholds are:

- Dataset 1, 2, 4, 5: Achieve > 90% accuracy
* Dataset 3: Achieve > 60% accuracy
### Selected Models for Each Dataset
- Dataset 1, 2, 4, 5: Best accuracy achieved with KNN.
* Dataset 3: Best accuracy achieved with Random Forest (RF).
